
Emissions in 2020 were 10% below 2019 levels. This was driven partly by the
marked decrease in fossil fuel consumption (Figure 7.2) due to travel
restrictions during the lockdown, which led to a reduction in refining output
and oil and gas production. Indeed, in each of these sectors, emissions in
2020 fell by 1.5 MtCO2 and 1.7 MtCO2, respectively, compared to 2019
levels.

Indeed, coal demand in the UK has continued to fall, especially in the
electricity sector, which contributed to 59% of emissions reductions in
the fuel supply sector since 1990. Over half of the remaining emissions
from the coal mining sub-sector are due to methane leakage from
closed coal mines, rather than ongoing coal mining. As mines
continue to close in the UK, there is less and less scope for emissions
reductions in this area.
</br>
Declining oil and gas reserves have led to reduced production, and
therefore emissions reductions. Remaining recoverable oil reserves
have decreased by 44% since 1995, and gas reserves by 75% in the
same period.6 This trend is set to continue as oil and gas production is
expected to decline by 6% on average per year to 2030.
</br>
Emissions from methane leakage in the gas transmission and
distribution networks reduced notably thanks to the Iron Mains Risk
Reduction Programme (IMRRP),8 with gas network emissions reduced
by 46% since 2002 when the programme was introduced. Emissions in
this area should continue to decline as the IMRRP is set to run until
2032.
