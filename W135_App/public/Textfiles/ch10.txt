The emissions savings over the preceding decade were driven in part
by a 26% fall in domestic shipping activity and a 7% reduction in
outbound international freight shipping, due largely to significant
reductions in the quantities of oil and coal being transported. In
addition, global vessel carbon intensities improved by around 30%
between 2008 and 2018.
