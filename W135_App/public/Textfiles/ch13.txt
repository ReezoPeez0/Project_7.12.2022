Indicators for the UK are the total deployment of engineered removals, and
of the contributions to this total from BECCS, DACCS and Wood in
Construction (WiC). BECCS, DACCS, or a combination of the two, are
expected in the Net Zero Strategy to start removing CO2 in the late 2020s.
Underpinning developments in CCS infrastructure need to be scaled up this
year and are being tracked through the indicator on industrial CCS
candidate projects in Chapter 5 and the indicator on CO2 storage licences
in Chapter 14.
